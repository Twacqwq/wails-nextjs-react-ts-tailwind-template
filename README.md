## About

Create a nextjs-ts application using wails and add tailwindcss

```bash
wails init -n "Your Project Name" -t https://github.com/Twacqwq/wails-nextjs-react-ts-tailwind-template
cd "Your Project Name"/frontend
npm i
```

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
